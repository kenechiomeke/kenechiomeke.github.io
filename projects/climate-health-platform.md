- Technical lead developing a global Platform (hosted on the UN Global Data Platform) for sharing standards for official statistics on the health impacts of climate change (Â£5m Wellcome Trust-funded project). Responsible for building the backend of the platform (Flask, CSS/HTML and Javascript), modularising scripts written in R and Python following RAP principles and converting them into open-source packages with an API endpoint accessible from the web platform.
- Develop an open-source package in R containing globally generalisable statistical models on the impact of climate indicators on human health. Models developed by topic global experts.
- Developed templates for code and documentation for topic leads (at ONS and international partner organisations) developing models of the impact of different climate indicators to feed into the open-source package. Lead and train topic leads on the adoption of RAP principles and use of collaboration/version controls tools such as Git/GitHub.
- Created and manage the organisational GitHub workspace for the project. Onboarded all project members into respective teams and developed a kanban board using GitHub Projects to track issues, monitor progress and enhance collaboration. Trained and oversee the adoption of best practices such as protected (main) branch, use of pre-commit hooks via lint-staged, unit testing all functions, created easy-to-use pull request templates and ensured code is reviewed by two team members.  
- Contributed to an open-source package in Python that collects gridded climate data from open-sources such as Corpenicus (ERA5) and OpenAQ, and provides them in easily accessible dataframe-formats for augmenting health datasets in regions without adequate weather monitoring stations.
- Regular stakeholder engagement: bi-weekly meeting with partners from Ghana and Rwanda; monthly expert advisory group (EAG) meeting to update on progress and learn from experts; monthly topic expert group (TEG) meetings with leading researchers from academic partner institutions to dissect proposed statistical models and review the underlying science; weekly catchups with UN technical team to review latest code/package updates prior to deployment on the UNGP.
